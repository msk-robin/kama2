		<p>What was once controversial is now an icon of Porsche's lineup. The automaker introduced its first SUV, the Cayenne, way back in 2002. Now in its third generation and having spawned an offshoot, the Cayenne Coupe, the Cayenne combines Porsche's decades-old design language with genuine utility and some of the best driving dynamics of any SUV.</p>

		<p>When it comes to moving an affluent family, there’s no better BMW than the X Series, the brand’s luxurious three-row SUV. While its cargo area and rearmost seats aren’t as spacious as rivals such as the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS-class, the Bimmer boasts better driving manners as well as an impressive selection of engines. They range from a 375-hp turbo-six to a 523-hp twin-turbo V-8, with the latter making 630 horses on the highest-class, max-performance Alpina XB7. All models have all-wheel drive and an adaptive air suspension that promotes a pillow-like ride. The 2023 X7’s interior is serene, but it’s also packed with upscale materials and modern tech such as the dash’s giant curved glass display. Those features, combined with the X7’s towing capability and an array of standard active-safety tech, make the biggest BMW one of the best.</p>

	<a href="https://www.audiusa.com/us/web/en/models/suv-models.html" target="_blank"><h3>AUDI</h3></a>
		<p>Like the rest of the Audi lineup, the 2022 Q7 SUV combines a handsome design, a technology-rich cabin, and a fun-loving chassis—it just does so with room for the whole family thanks to its standard three rows of seats. The entry-level engine is a 248-hp turbocharged four-cylinder, but those seeking more towing capacity or increased performance should opt for the 335-hp turbocharged V-6; all-wheel drive is standard with both engines. The Q7 can be outfitted with an adjustable air suspension and four-wheel steering for even greater comfort and agility. Despite all those features, the Q7 isn't quite as sporty as rivals such as the Porsche Cayenne, but it holds its own against the BMW X5, the Mercedes-Benz GLE, and the Volvo XC90.</p>
